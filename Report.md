Part A

Problems Faced:
1. Linking error problem that the .obj file could not be read from the data folder in the project folder
   Solved: By taking the absolute path of the file from the desktop directory
2. glm problem that the .obj file appeared as a 3D image not in vertices information
   Solved: TA Eslam Adel sent edited glm.cpp and glm.h files
3. Took a long time and effort to adjust the robot walking animation technique

You can find in the part 1 folder:
1. Assignment 3 zip folder containing:
- main.cpp
- image folder for texture mapping images
- data folder for .obj and .mtl file of objects
- imageloader and glm files
2. Demo video zip folder containing:
- Demo video to illustrate robot animation & texture mapping 
3. README explaining functions added, self-animation technqiues, loaded objects interaction animation techniques and texture mapping technique

Part B

(for sample outcome and GUI run check the README in part B)

Problems Faced:
1. Designing the GUI to appear in one single window not two (to be more applicable and professional)
2. Integrating both modes in one code without conflicts/errors
3. Applying the bonus part by making the transfer function variable

As for the contributions, we did look at some of the results of our colleuges to make sure we are on the right track

You can find in the part 2 folder:
- Assignment Code (app.py & win.py)
- Demo video to demonstrate how to run
- README explaining how to run along with sample results
- data folder containing dcm slices of Head and Ankle


Thank you.
