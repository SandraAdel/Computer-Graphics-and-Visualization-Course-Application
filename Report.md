Part A





Part B

(for sample outcome and GUI run check the README in part B)

Problems Faced:
1. Designing the GUI to appear in one single window not two (to be more applicable and professional)
2. Integrating both modes in one code without conflicts/errors
3. Applying the bonus part by making the transfer function variable

As for the contributions, we did look at some of the results of our colleuges to make sure we are on the right track

You can find in the part 2 folder:
- Assignment Code (app.py & win.py)
- Demo video to demonstrate how to run
- README explaining how to run along with sample results
- data folder containing dcm slices of Head and Ankle


Thank you.
